              Executive Summary
            </h2>

            <p>
              As AI agents begin to take action in the real world, the services
              and people they interact with need to know who they are, who
              instructed them, and what they are allowed to do. This is what
              agent IDs can provide: a set of information that identifies the
              agent, how it was assembled, who controls it, what the agent is
              permitted to do, and what to do if something goes wrong.
              Establishing solid technical foundations for AI agents at this
              technical level will enable future governance measures by
              industry or governments to sort, filter, and manage the activity
              of AI agents across their purviews. Today, no single standard
              exists for authenticating and authorising AI agents. Without
              one, trust remains low, adoption is slowed, and the risk of
              fragmented, incompatible, and insecure solutions grows.
            </p>

            <p>
              The contribution of this work is threefold. First, we identify
              common functions prescribed to agent IDs and map those onto
              existing ID protocols, such as OAuth, OIDC and MCP. We show that
              no single existing ID solution can reliably authenticate and
              authorise AI agents. Instead, agent IDs require a novel solution
              that is informed by and compatible with prior technical work.
              Second, we assess the private market incentives to effectively
              provide comprehensive agent IDs. Certain functions will likely
              be included in an industry-developed ID standard, while others
              require additional incentives to materialize at sufficient
              efficacy and speed. Aspects of agent IDs which private markets
              plausibly fail to provide pertain to an agent&rsquo;s security
              posture or highly sensitive user data, resulting from misaligned
              incentives or imperfect industry coordination. Third, we propose
              a design logic to direct the development of agent IDs. Rather
              than prescribing one particular formulation, we offer questions
              that identify a stakeholder&rsquo;s requirements and priorities
              to inform the exact structure and composition of the ID. We then
              develop a set of plausible positions on these design questions
              and demonstrate how answering those questions informs the final
              ID design.

            <p>
              Agent IDs refer to the set of identifiers and other metadata
              that AI agents include in their interactions with other
              entities. Today, typical internet web requests usually include
              identifiers and related metadata about who is originating the
              request. We will use the term &ldquo;IDs&rdquo; to refer to this
              collection of information which usually includes the requesting
              user&rsquo;s computer operating system, browser, IP address,
              access credentials, and more. Services use these IDs for
              ensuring the requests are authenticated, authorized, and
              accountable. IDs also often describe technical compatibility
              such as the format and style of information that the requesting
              user prefers such as the type and version of their
              computer&rsquo;s operating system. There is currently no
              defined standard for which aspects of traditional digital IDs
              should be included in agent IDs and which additional
              information should be incorporated.
            </p>

            <p>
              AI agents pose distinct risks to the services they interact
              with. Agents operating autonomously across open-ended tasks
              over prolonged time horizons can behave erratically and cause
              damage at a rapid pace and scale. Recent incidents illustrate
              how agents can cause unintended damage even when operating
              within the deployer&rsquo;s own systems: Amazon&apos;s Kiro
              assistant autonomously deleted a production environment it was
              deployed to fix, causing a 13-hour outage; and an OpenClaw
              agent mass-deleted its deployer&rsquo;s, senior AI
              researcher&apos;s, inbox while ignoring repeated stop commands.
              Agent IDs will provide tools for services to manage these kinds
              of risks that external agents can pose while still benefiting
              from the improved efficiency reliable agents can provide.
            </p>
            {/* TODO from ZS: the above paragraph describes two incidents, none of which will be solved by agent IDs.
            One possible way around is to quote the examples, but in a separate paragraph say how agents might do much more in the future,
             and that some infrastructure for IDs might mitigate those future risks. */}

            <p>
              Agent IDs are often linked to one or several of the following
              functionalities: <strong>authentication, authorization,
              incident prevention, accountability, and compatibility</strong>.
              By providing one or several of these functions, ID solutions
              will play an essential role in supporting the anticipated
              widespread diffusion of AI agents, assuring their safety,
              security, and trustworthiness. While authentication and to a
              lesser extent authorization are often presented as core
              features of agent IDs, setting the exact functional scope
              ultimately depends on specific operational and policy
              priorities. Table 1 illustrates each functionality and
              discusses how they may address common problems of safely and
              efficiently diffusing AI agents within society.

              IDs are essential for realizing the economic gains from AI
              agents but must be harmonized and interoperable to avoid
              fragmentation. Beyond risk mitigation, IDs provide the trust
              necessary for businesses and users to adopt autonomous agents,
              particularly in high-stakes sectors like finance. To achieve
              this, agent IDs must be compatible with existing industry
              standards, such as OAuth, and should ideally follow
              standardized frameworks themselves. In practice, this requires
              coordination among international public bodies, for instance
              the network of AI Safety Institutes (AISIs), alongside an
              active dialogue with industry stakeholders.
            </p>

            <p>
              The goal of this memo is to <strong>explore the relevant
              option space of agent ID solutions</strong>, drawing on
              learnings from existing ID solutions. Rather than prescribing a
              definitive path forward, which is contingent on a series of
              policy and operational considerations, we aim to structure the
              decision-making process for defining relevant requirements.
              These requirements determine the optimal design and
              implementation of agent IDs.
            </p>

            <p>
              The rest of this memo is structured as follows.{" "}
              <strong>Section 2</strong> presents core components of agent
              IDs and explains how they interact with external services and
              interfaces. <strong>Section 3</strong> presents an analysis of
              seven ID solutions, including both solutions used in other
              domains and emerging agent ID solutions offered by industry
              actors. <strong>Section 4</strong> outlines ten questions to
              inform the definition of functional, technical and structural
              requirements for agent IDs. For each question we formulate a
              preliminary hypothesis on the potential position of a
              government agency responsible for AI guidance or regulations.
              Based on these hypotheses we present a preliminary agent ID
              design, showing how specific requirements shape the ultimate
              design. <strong>Section 5</strong> offers preliminary
              recommendations and outlines next steps.

              2. Components of Agent IDs
            </h2>

            <p>
              Entities across the technical system supporting AI agents may
              participate in the construction and use of agent IDs. Each
              entity has different roles, responsibilities, access to
              information, and incentives as they relate to agent IDs. The
              diagram below describes the primary relationships between
              these entities for a specific request initiated by an AI Agent
              instance to an online service.

              To provide intuition about the core elements in the system
              diagram, consider an everyday use-case for an AI agent such as
              cancelling a meeting on the agent&rsquo;s deployer&rsquo;s
              online calendar. In this situation, the entities could be:
            </p>

            <ul className="memo-list">
              <li>
                <strong>Developer:</strong> Foundation model developer that
                produces the original LLM that powers the AI agent.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Provider:</strong> A specialized company providing a
                digital assistant AI agent service directly to consumers. It
                leverages the developer&rsquo;s business APIs to power their
                agent.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Deployer:</strong> An individual using the
                provider&rsquo;s services to operate their digital
                assistant. They have prompted the agent to handle incoming
                messages to the deployer&rsquo;s phone. It receives a
                message from one of the deployer&rsquo;s contacts that
                requests to cancel a scheduled meeting.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>AI Agent Instance:</strong> The deployer&rsquo;s AI
                Agent, operating under the deployer&rsquo;s prompts. The
                agent receives the meeting cancellation request and
                initiates an action to delete the calendar event from the
                deployer&rsquo;s online calendar. The request it sends to
                the calendar application contains the Agent ID which carries
                authentication and authorization information, among other
                data.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Service:</strong> The online calendar service
                connected to the deployer&apos;s personal account. The
                service receives the AI Agent&rsquo;s request, including the
                Agent ID, and has to decide whether to honor it and cancel
                the meeting.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Registry:</strong> An external data source that
                contains information about the deployer, specific AI Agents
                and/or AI Agent Instances. The entry in a registry could
                contain summary statistics about the number and types of
                incidents that have been associated with a particular Agent
                product, or the results of safety tests that a provider has
                conducted on their Agent. The service may seek this extra
                information to make its decision about honoring the incoming
                request.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Incident Responders:</strong> If something has gone
                wrong, the service may request assistance from external
                experts. Perhaps in this case the service contacts a private
                cybersecurity consultant to respond to the incident and
                investigate the error. The incident responder may work
                directly with the service and/or examine information logged
                by the service, which could include the Agent ID, during
                their investigation.

            <p>
              We analysed seven ID-relevant solutions from other domains and
              emerging agent ID solutions provided by industry actors.
              Identification solutions are already well established across
              many digital domains. We examined existing ID and ID-like
              systems to determine their capacity to manage agent IDs and to
              derive general design lessons. The systems were chosen to: (i)
              cover solutions from other domains which provide one or
              several of the functions typically associated with agent IDs;
              and (ii) present any emerging agent ID frameworks, for
              instance deployed in the private sector.

              what or who they identify, and where control over the ID

              <li>
                <strong>OAuth 2.0:</strong> OAuth is the industry-standard
                open protocol for client authorisation. It relies on scoped
                access tokens that encode permitted actions (e.g.
                &lsquo;read emails&rsquo; or &lsquo;edit this
                calendar&rsquo;) across services.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>OpenID Connect (OIDC):</strong> OIDC is generally
                added as an identity layer built on top of OAuth 2.0,
                providing a cryptographically verifiable answer to who is
                acting, but not what they are allowed to do. OIDC is a
                promising candidate for the authentication feature of agent
                IDs because it standardises how a third party can verify a
                principal&rsquo;s identity without managing passwords or
                credentials directly.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Model Context Protocol (MCP):</strong> MCP defines a
                shared, structured interaction layer that standardises how
                agents can use external tools, acting as a coordination
                interface between agents and tool endpoints. Because
                MCP&rsquo;s request format has limited identity and
                metadata fields, it is ill-suited to carrying robust agent
                identities without protocol extensions or modifications.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Agent Payments Protocol (AP2):</strong> AP2 is an
                open protocol for initiating and transacting agent-led
                payments across platforms. It delivers guarantees of intent
                and provenance for payment actions through cryptographically
                signed &ldquo;mandates&rdquo; that encode explicit human
                consent, tailored to payment-specific notions like total
                spending ceilings. AP2 demonstrates the value of modular
                designs for agent IDs that are capable of carrying
                domain-specific solutions when those are available.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>National Digital IDs:</strong> These IDs can provide
                high assurance, state-backed identity and legal
                accountability. These systems may allow individuals to share
                specific personal data securely stored across government
                systems with external services. However, they are not
                designed for autonomous delegation, agent-to-agent use, or
                open interoperability. In agent systems, national IDs could
                function as an identity anchor, linking agents to a verified
                human principal.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Microsoft Entra:</strong> Entra extends enterprise
                governance to AI agents, allowing organisations to create
                centralized agent registries, through which they can assign
                unique identities to agents, apply policies like conditional
                access and monitor activity through audit logs (e.g.
                recording every creation of an agent). The model enforces
                least-privilege access focused on resource and network
                boundaries (e.g. file upload restrictions) which mirrors
                existing enterprise access management practices. Entra is
                commercial and closed-source which limits its broad
                application for public sector applications.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>MCP-I:</strong> MCP-I plans to provide an
                open-source extension of MCP, creating identity, delegation,
                and auditing layers for AI agents. It suggests utilizing
                DIDs, fully decentralized identifiers, which can be mapped
                to existing identity systems (e.g. OAuth/OIDC). It aims to
                encode versatile delegation scopes and suggests linking
                agents to public trust registries like KnowThat.ai. MCP-I
                appears to still be under development at this time, but
                could serve as a helpful blueprint or perhaps a specific
                solution to rely on once it matures.

                  No single existing system is sufficient to serve as an
                  agent ID framework.
                </strong>{" "}
                Instead, agent IDs likely require a layered architecture
                combining (i) identity assurance (e.g. OIDC, National IDs),
                (ii) delegated authority (OAuth), (iii) structured
                interaction semantics (MCP), and (iv) domain-specific
                additions (AP2). These systems and protocols each operate at
                different layers and serve different purposes. Designing
                agent IDs therefore starts with clarity about purpose before

                Market incentives alone are likely to fail to provide IDs
                which facilitate high-risk uses of agents,
              </strong>{" "}
              which must reliably secure sensitive information and offer
              robust security assurances. Issues arise not only from slow
              industry coordination, but also from misaligned incentives
              and inadequate trust assurance mechanisms. Adoption of AI
              agents in highly valuable domains depends on solving these
              open problems. While there are market incentives for the
              creation of many agent ID features, the distribution of
              incentives varies across four key actors in agent ID
              ecosystems.

            <ul className="memo-list">
              <li>
                <strong>Model developers:</strong> Companies which create
                the underlying models the agent is based on. Model IDs
                would correspond to the foundation model the agent is based
                on.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Agent providers:</strong> Companies which provide
                the AI agents. This may involve using pre-built agents
                based on other developers&rsquo; models (e.g., Zapier
                Agents) or modifying existing ones such as adding
                scaffolding and tooling to open source models.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Deployers:</strong> Companies or individuals
                deploying the agent. In the case of a company or individual
                designing their own agent from scratch, they would be both
                the deployer and agent provider.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Services:</strong> Third parties which the agent
                interacts with, such as online stores or financial
                institutions.

            <p>
              <strong>
                Market incentives will likely drive adoption of minimal
                forms of ID,
              </strong>{" "}
              sufficient in low-risk contexts, such as IDs to distinguish
              AI agents from human users, as is required by existing laws
              around disclosing AI usage (e.g., EU AI Act Art. 50).
              Further, we expect to see the emergence of specialised IDs
              in specific domains, such as for online transactions or to
              enable internal debugging.
            </p>

            <p>
              Agent providers and deployers will have little reason to
              disclose the underlying model or tool access, even though
              this information aids security assessment and incident
              response. Conversely, services may request overly expansive
              agent information, creating privacy risks without comparable
              benefits. Identifying technical solutions, with reference
              implementations, will help balance information and
              incentives to satisfy requirements from both deployers and
              services. Improving consensus on agent ID implementation and
              disclosure standards may further catalyze broader private
              sector adoption of responsible ID practices. This may lead
              to greater accountability for accidents involving AI agents,
              better security assurances, and another lever for mitigating
              malicious use of agents.

              5. Options for implementing agent IDs
            </h2>

            <p>
              Functional, technical, and governance requirements determine
              the optimal design and implementation of agent IDs. Such
              mirrors standard software development and recognizes that the
              ideal solution is contingent upon specific policy priorities
              and operational constraints, which we operationalize into a
              non-exhaustive set of 10 questions to guide the development
              of requirements. For each question, we evaluate the
              associated options and trade-offs, providing an initial
              overview of the design landscape. However, subsequent work is
              required to validate the exhaustiveness of these requirements
              and to systematically define the position of a government
              agency.

                The benefits for accountability, incident response, and
                transparency are maximized when services log the full agent
                IDs they receive alongside other typical data such as the
                contents and metadata of the agent&rsquo;s request.
                Detailed logging is likely also in the interest of the
                service itself, if possible and permissible. Mandating
                specific logging practices is outside the scope of agent ID
                solutions, but final technical designs and specifications
                could facilitate logging practices that support the
                public&rsquo;s interests.

              Based on our preliminary hypotheses, we have derived a
              stylized design for agent IDs. This section explores how
              specific answers to the guiding questions inform the
              technical and functional requirements of an agent ID,
              reflecting the hypothesized preferences of a government
              agency. As part of this discussion, we are also considering
              the viability of enforcing such an agent ID and the various
              incentives such frameworks create for uptake. It should be
              noted that this design serves only as an indicative starting
              point; it must be revised as each question is revisited to
              produce more granular requirements.

            </h2>

            <p>
              AgentIDs are essential technical foundations that unlock the
              full scale of benefits from AI agents. They provide an
              opportunity to fill technical and policy objectives
              surrounding the functioning, security, and governance of AI
              agents. Our analysis shows that no single existing ID
              solution offers all functions relevant to the authentication
              and authorisation of AI agents. Instead, agent IDs require
              novel solutions that are informed by and compatible with
              existing technical standards.
            </p>

            <p>
              We expect private market incentives alone to fail to provide
              agent IDs suitable for high-risk use cases. In high-risk
              domains like finance or healthcare, services will plausibly
              demand stronger security assurances before granting agents
              access and agents will need to handle sensitive personal
              data, for instance to satisfy existing KYC requirements. No
              single industry effort is likely to command sufficient trust
              for competing actors to embed highly sensitive, yet
              necessary, data in its agent ID scheme. Taken together,
              these dynamics create an opportunity for the government to
              coordinate the creation of agent IDs tailored to higher-risk
              requirements.
            </p>

            <p>
              We suggest the development of agent IDs follows standard
              software development practices, starting with the
              specification of functional and technical requirements. The
              guiding questions offered will help stakeholders map their
              preferences to the possible features of agent IDs to inform
              their design and implementation of policies, standards, and
              technical solutions. Because different priorities can lead
              to different designs, it seems unlikely that a single agent
              ID solution is optimal across all use-cases and contexts.
              Interoperability between different agent IDs will be
              necessary to avoid fragmentation.
            </p>

            <p>
              Designing and implementing agent IDs is a critical step
              towards safer and more reliable AI Agents operating in the
              digital world. Including more members of the ecosystem in
              building agent IDs, and providing proper incentives for them
              to adopt the results, will be necessary for these solutions
              to achieve broad impact. Many private and public sector
              entities benefit from secure and reliable AI agent systems
              but may not know what to ask for, or from whom, to achieve
              those objectives. Increased awareness and understanding of
              how Agent IDs can provide those additional options and
              levers so we can quickly move the AI agent ecosystem towards
              more sound and sustainable footing.
